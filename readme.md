# Dootstrap (beta) - A minimalist SCSS grid

A super lean SCSS grid based on the 12-column philosphy of Bootstrap. This is a work-in-progress SCSS framework I use on my own projects.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in to the /public folder of your project (or where ever you store your front end assets).
Run `npm install` then `gulp watch` to compile your SCSS and JS files. Run `gulp` for final production compiling. To copy over any NPM dependencies into the front end JS folder, run `gulp js-modules` - for CSS dependencies run `gulp css-modules`. This library makes heavy use of `flexbox`.
