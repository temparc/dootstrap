# Tempstrap (beta) - A minimalist SCSS grid

A super lean SCSS grid based on the 12-column philosphy of Bootstrap. This is a work-in-progress SCSS framework I use on my own projects.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in to the /public folder of your project (or where ever you store your front end assets).
Run `npm install` then `gulp watch` to compile your SCSS and JS files. Run `gulp` for final production compiling.
